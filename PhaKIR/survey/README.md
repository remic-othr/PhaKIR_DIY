## Challenge Feedback

As part of the challenge, two short surveys were created to gather feedback:

- One for participants who **registered but did not submit a result** (`no_submission_survey.pdf`)
- One for participants who **successfully submitted a result** (`submission_survey.pdf`)

### Participation Summary

- A total of **66 participants registered**
- **16 teams submitted results**

### Survey Responses (2 received)

Although the response rate was low (only 2 completed surveys), we are including the results here for completeness.

#### Feedback from non-submitting participants

- **Reason for not submitting**: Both responses cited **lack of time** as the main reason.
- **Requested support/information**: No specific technical or instructional shortcomings were mentioned.
- **Future participation**: Both respondents indicated that they would consider participating in future challenges on this self-hosted platform.
- **Additional comments**: One comment highlighted that the challenge was well organized, despite their inability to participate due to time constraints.

#### Feedback from submitting participants

- **Technical platform**:
  - Both respondents **strongly agreed** that:
    - The platform was easy to use
    - The submission process was smooth
    - No technical issues were encountered
- **Organizational aspects**:
  - One respondent **agreed**, and one **strongly agreed** that:
    - The rules and guidelines were clear and accessible
    - Communication from the organizers was timely and helpful
    - Support for troubleshooting was effective
- **Prior experience**: One participant had previously taken part in **two other challenges** (e.g., hosted on Synapse or Grand Challenge)

### Conclusion

While the limited number of responses does not allow for statistically significant conclusions, the available feedback suggests that participants who engaged with the challenge had a **very positive technical and organizational experience**. For future challenges, addressing **time constraints** and improving **early communication** may help increase the number of submissions.
